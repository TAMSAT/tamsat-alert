This module contains functions for extracting data from multifile NetCDF
datasets, for use in conjunction with the TAMSAT alert system.

It is currently in early stages and only contains a single function
for extracting data at a point.  It will later contain methods for
averaging over a bounding box, or potentially over a shapefile
(so that averages for an entire country can be easily extracted)
